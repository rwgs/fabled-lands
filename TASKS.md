# Fabled Lands — Web Edition · Engineering TODO

Backlog of recommended improvements. Open tasks are filed under priority buckets
(**HIGH** / **MEDIUM** / **LOW**) — work the first open (`- [ ]`) item top-down;
each task's detail section carries the same stable ID. Every filed task through
212 is complete (listed under **Done** below), apart from 207, withdrawn as a
misdiagnosis (see the Review log); **213, 214 and 215 are open**, all three
renderer defects that books 1–6 carry today.
Completed detail sections are archived in
[`TASKS-archive.md`](TASKS-archive.md); the Review log at the end of this file
records each audit pass and is where new work is filed.

**HIGH**

*(none open — file new HIGH work here)*

**MEDIUM**

- [ ] 213. The post-fight gate does not hold an item award, so loot is takeable before the fight
- [ ] 214. A visit-box redirect does not hold the section body, so a one-time reward is re-takeable

**LOW**

- [ ] 215. A self-closing effect tag renders no words, so published sentences print with a hole

**Done**

- [x] 69. Bare post-fight `<lose>/<gain>` apply on entry, not on the fight outcome (§570 + 7 more)
- [x] 70. Visit box renders unticked on the visit it ticks; bare `<tick/>` prints "If not, , and read on" (§496 + widespread)
- [x] 71. `<lose staminato="N">` never applies — the handler is gated on a `stamina=` attr it lacks (16 sections)
- [x] 72. "codeword gained" notification fires even when the codeword was already held
- [x] 73. Ship dock/current-vessel state is not maintained — any owned ship can sail or trade from anywhere *(core done; todock= + sailing-ship pointer split → task 81)*
- [x] 74. Standalone `force="f"` effects auto-apply — missions/initiations cannot be declined; choose-one losses over-apply
- [x] 75. Live `<tick>` forms for equipment, profession changes and patterned titles are incomplete/inert
- [x] 76. Blessings are stored as inert labels — ability/Luck/travel benefits cannot be used *(core rerolls done; combat Defence/Wrath split → task 80)*
- [x] 77. Selector-aware `<set item|cache …>` expressions read the sheet instead of the selected item/cache (21 nodes)
- [x] 78. Validate numeric `<section name>` against its filename; fix five mismatched source files
- [x] 79. Keeping a preview or importing a save reports success when persistence fails
- [x] 80. Combat blessings: expose Defence through Faith (+3, one fight) and Divine Wrath (1d pre-damage) as fight-widget buttons *(split from task 76)*
- [x] 81. Ships: honour `todock=` and track which at-large ship is being sailed *(split from task 73)*
- [x] 82. Test harness: a duplicate top-level `const` in `run()` silently aborts the whole suite (reads as a hang, not a failure)
- [x] 83. Combat blessings (Wrath/Defence) buttons appear only on the single-fight widget, not group fights *(split from task 80)*
- [x] 84. De-flake the "fight attack produces a log line" test (timing-dependent on the 900 ms dice animation)
- [x] 85. book6/135 source: `tag="keep"` is a stray/misnamed attribute (likely meant `tags=`); harmless but should be cleaned
- [x] 86. Add a full-section render integration test for book5/386 (currently covered only by synthetic ticks) *(added; surfaced the §386 enchant-cycle bug → task 88)*
- [x] 87. Fight widget "Your Combat" omits the per-fight attack bonus (`special="attack"`), unlike the Defence line
- [x] 88. book5/386: the hidden `removetag="Tz"` cleanup fires on entry, so Targdaz's weapon-enchant roll/outcomes never land (weapon never changes)
- [x] 89. Ship actions still use remote vessels, and `<choice sail>` does not sail one
- [x] 90. Permanent Safety from Storms is deleted by storm-avoidance `<lose blessing>` nodes
- [x] 91. COMBAT blessing cannot reroll an attack, and Defence blessing leaks between fights

- [x] 102. §1.338's standalone `<price>` does not charge for or complete the poison cure
- [x] 103. §4.658: `initialCrew="oldcrew"` ignores the `oldcrew` variable — the salvaged barque's crew resets to average
- [x] 104. Travel rolls don't gate the section's onward choices; a "get lost" outcome doesn't suppress them (§1.278/§1.82 + every travel section)
- [x] 105. `<if ticks="N">` reads the live count — this visit's own `<tick/>` flips the guard on a mid-visit rerender, re-showing the "already ticked → goto" redirect (§1.496)
- [x] 106. Light mode is force-darkened on Chrome/Edge — Chromium "Auto Dark Theme"; `color-scheme: light` doesn't opt out, needs `only light` *(fixed; leather-chrome-in-both-themes remains an intentional design note)*
- [x] 107. Visible `<transfer>` actions auto-execute and ignore chooser/filter/price semantics *(fixed; surfaced the §4.456 `<lose bonus>` gap → task 113)*
- [x] 108. `<outcome blessing="…">` ignores Safety from Storms and exposes the capsize/storm redirect *(fixed; surfaced the reroll-form non-consume → task 114)*
- [x] 109. Multi-ability success routing ignores `<success ability="…">` (§2.37 always takes SANCTITY)
- [x] 110. `<return>` starts a fresh visit instead of restoring the section at the point it was left
- [x] 111. Rolled `itemAt=` losses can remove `keep`-tagged possessions
- [x] 112. The Adventure Sheet stores but cannot activate a curse's `lift=` prompt (§5.505)
- [x] 113. `<lose item="?" bonus="N">` ignores `bonus=` — §4.456 accepts any item as a +2/+3 offering
- [x] 114. Reroll-form storm sections (§232/502/716) never consume the blessing — the rerunnable `keepblessing=1` set resets the guard each render
- [x] 115. Adventure-Sheet item detours bypass `Story.navigate`, so `<return>` still re-enters the source section
- [x] 116. Save/load restarts the current visit — effects can repeat and rolls/return state disappear
- [x] 117. Priced equipment/cargo losses can arm their reward without taking the required payment
- [x] 118. Choice/equipment losses can remove `keep`-tagged possessions *(immediately after 117 — same shared loss matcher)*
- [x] 119. Re-establish the rules/view boundary and split the 4,060-line renderer by responsibility
- [x] 120. Split the 4,790-line single-scope browser test into focused ES-module suites *(before the test-heavy 115–117 chain)*
- [x] 121. The documented `powershell` build command no longer parses `build-data.ps1` on Windows PowerShell 5.1
- [x] 122. Roll-less `<outcome codeword=…>` decision tables never resolve — eight sections render as dead ends
- [x] 123. "Immunity to Disease and Poison" is stored under two un-aliased names — the blessing never protects
- [x] 124. Loading/importing a save clamps Stamina to the written max — aura Stamina (ring of ultimate power) is silently stripped
- [x] 125. Flag-linked item rewards outside choose-one menus are free, and paying can never grant them
- [x] 126. A collapsed `<group>` action never executes its `<buy>` children — §5.192's ship and §4.622's cargo are unobtainable
- [x] 127. Abbreviated cargo names (`grai`, `meta`, …) are never canonicalised — the trans-book trading economy is broken
- [x] 128. A bare `ability=` disjunct on `<if>` is always true — §5.680 gives away the ring of ultimate power
- [x] 129. Free fixed-amount `<rest stamina="N">` is infinitely repeatable — every hospitality rest heals to full
- [x] 130. Inline `<buy>` allows one purchase per visit; JaFL's default is unlimited ("buy as many as you can afford")
- [x] 131. Cache `max=` semantics: `max="0"` must bar deposits (§4.263 money-doubling), and item caches must store Shards (§6.512)
- [x] 132. `<if blessing="?">` never matches — §5.365's chapel stacks blessings
- [x] 133. Adventure-Sheet mutations (drop/lift) leave the story pane stale — item-gated choices stay live after the item is gone
- [x] 134. Market sells with several candidates silently take the first match — JaFL asks which ship/item to sell
- [x] 135. Renouncing a god keeps that god's resurrection deal
- [x] 136. Engine grab-bag #2: `transfer tenth=`, named-cargo loss quantity, `effect description=`, `<set>` identifier edges, `<buy force="t">`
- [x] 137. A save blob can persist without its `fl_meta` entry — the orphaned slot turns invisible and gets overwritten
- [x] 138. Offline navigations with a query string bypass the service-worker cache
- [x] 139. The Adventure Sheet never shows foreign-currency balances
- [x] 140. Docs/CI accuracy: AGENTS.md's smoke-test URL 404s and the CI grep misses `RESULT FATAL`
- [x] 141. Archive completed task details out of TASKS.md
- [x] 142. CI's smoke verdict greps the whole DOM dump — failing runs are misdiagnosed as bootstrap FATALs
- [x] 143. A failing `ok()` fired after the report is silently lost — a latent silent-pass vector
- [x] 144. meta.json embeds the build date — a no-op rebuild busts every installed player's cache
- [x] 145. payChoiceCost validates a tag/wildcard item payment it can never consume *(latent — no corpus trigger)*
- [x] 146. A roll's dice animation leaves other controls live — the pending result lands on the wrong visit
- [x] 147. Navigation has no in-flight guard — a double-click double-runs leave hooks and entry effects
- [x] 148. undo() leaves a stale return frame — a post-undo `<return>` re-enters a pre-undo visit
- [x] 149. A priced sail choice pays before the ship chooser — an abandoned chooser eats the payment
- [x] 150. renderIfChain's list path runs `<else>`/`<elseif>` unconditionally *(latent — no corpus trigger)*
- [x] 151. The dead-end fallback counts disabled controls — an unaffordable forced payment can softlock
- [x] 152. View-layer polish grab-bag #1: begin() scaffold duplication, modal close handle, demo dead end, TTS nits, buy-parse duplication
- [x] 153. Accessibility quick wins: aria-live for toasts/rolls/fight log; dialog semantics + Escape for modals
- [x] 154. begin() autosaves the NEW section paired with the OLD visit ctx — resume aliases foreign memos onto the new section
- [x] 155. One-shot memos are written after the state mutation they guard — a reload repeats rests, buys, and failed rolls
- [x] 156. A mid-visit reload silently drops armed `<tick special="attack|defence">` bonuses and penalties
- [x] 157. Item-name glob patterns never match — §4.482/§6.201 unreachable, §6.144's trophy head never taken
- [x] 158. Two written-max Stamina clamps still strip aura headroom (task 124's remaining siblings)
- [x] 159. Resurrection revives at half Stamina — the book and JaFL both say full
- [x] 160. Loss-matcher follow-ups: named equipment losses never filter by name; `losePaymentPlan` ignores `multiple=` *(both latent)*
- [x] 161. Visit transitions can persist a destination position with the source visit memo — reload drops exact return/undo state
- [x] 162. Continuing combat redraws without persisting the updated fight memo — reload rewinds the round
- [x] 163. Post-refactor module/docs cleanup: break the roll/choice cycle and align the architecture contract
- [x] 164. Focused test suites still import the old whole-harness dependency set and boot unrelated app code
- [x] 165. Re-archive completed task details 115–160 and clear them out of the priority buckets
- [x] 166. Direct visit commits bypass persistence observers — save failures stay silent and activity timestamps go stale
- [x] 167. Mutation-bearing navigation is not atomic — a failed/pending cross-book load can consume payment without completing the move
- [x] 168. An open navigation transaction leaves unrelated UI live and globally suppresses its saves
- [x] 169. Durable-consequence navigation has no abort/retry contract — failed resurrection, flee, combat or item detours can strand the action
- [x] 170. Centralise duplicated display helpers already owned by `render-util.js`
- [x] 171. Deduplicate the single/group combat control shell without merging their rules
- [x] 172. Deduplicate roll-widget/gate/memo scaffolding without building a generic roll renderer
- [x] 173. Durable-navigation retry targets disappear on reload — the spent consequence can become a permanent dead end
- [x] 174. The controllable async-navigation test fixture is copied three times in one suite
- [x] 175. Blessing rerolls keep the rejected roll's branch effects — damage/rewards can survive or stack

> **Completed task details (tasks 1–211) are archived** in [`TASKS-archive.md`](TASKS-archive.md) (tasks 141, 165, 211) to keep this file focused on open work. The checklist above still carries every task's stable ID and status; a done task's detail lives in the archive under the same `## <N>.` heading. Task 212's detail is still below, awaiting the next re-archive pass; the open tasks 213–215 and the Review log follow it.

## 212. `titleCase` capitalises the letter after an apostrophe ("Ghoul'S Head")

**Priority: LOW — cosmetic, but it is in the shared display helper, so it affects every book.**

`titleCase` in `web/js/render-util.js` was `s.replace(/\b\w/g, (c) => c.toUpperCase())`. A word
boundary sits after an apostrophe, so a possessive item name rendered with a stray capital:
book1/517's `<item name="ghoul's head"/>` showed as "Ghoul'S Head", as did `pirate captain's head`
and `boar's tusk`. It surfaced anywhere `itemLabel`/`bonusSuffix` runs — award buttons, the
Adventure Sheet, market rows.

Fixed by matching the word-initial letter with its preceding character instead of a bare word
boundary — `/(^|[^\w'’])(\w)/g`, upper-casing only the captured letter — so a `\w` directly after
an apostrophe, straight or curly, is skipped and everything else is unchanged. `suite-render`
pins both halves: "ghoul's head" → "Ghoul's Head" and "merchant’s cloak" → "Merchant’s Cloak",
while "silver holy symbol", "fur cloak" and hyphenated "half-elf charm" title-case as before.

Found during conversion work on an unpublished book, whose `merchant's cloak` renders the same
way. The corpus has carried possessive item names since book 1.

---

## 213. The post-fight gate does not hold an item award, so loot is takeable before the fight

**Priority: MEDIUM — a live rules leak in books 1–6 today, and it blocks conversion work.**

Task 69's fight gate holds a *bare post-fight effect* until the fight resolves, then applies only
the branch actually taken. `computeFightGate` (`web/js/render-gates.js`) builds that hold from two
node sets: `navNodes` — every `goto`/`choice`/`return` after the `<fight>` — and `effectNodes`,
which it populates from **`lose` and `gain` only**:

```js
if (seenFight && !skip && !gated && (tag === 'lose' || tag === 'gain') && …)
```

The item family is absent. `renderItemAward` (`web/js/render-rewards.js`) never consults
`story.fightGate` either, so an `<item>`/`<weapon>`/`<armour>`/`<tool>` award written after a
`<fight>` in the same section renders a **live Take button before the fight is fought**. The
navigation is correctly held, so the player cannot leave — but they can pocket the loot and then
lose.

Books 1–6 have carried this since book 1. Confirmed against a real `GameState`: book1/55 is
`<fight name="Cultist" …/> If you win, you find a <item name="bag of pearls"/> on his body.` —
its `<goto section="10">` renders disabled, its Take button renders **enabled**, and clicking it
puts the pearls on the sheet with the cultist untouched. book5/162's magic lockpicks have the same
shape (its `<gain shards="15"/>` in the same sentence *is* held, so one half of the reward waits
and the other does not). book2/469 shows the corpus already works around it by hand, wrapping the
dragon's-head award in `<if dead="f">`.

The fix is symmetrical with the existing hold: classify item-family awards into `effectNodes`
alongside `lose`/`gain`, and give `renderItemAward` (and `renderReplaceAward`) the held state —
a disabled Take rather than an omitted one, matching how a held `<lose>`/`<gain>` still shows its
words. Regression coverage belongs in `suite-combat`: book1/55's Take is disabled while the fight
is unresolved, live after a win, and never live after a loss.

Found during conversion work on an unpublished book, which has four sections of the same shape
held back until this is fixed — converting them first would add new instances of the leak rather
than expose the old ones.

---

## 214. A visit-box redirect does not hold the section body, so a one-time reward is re-takeable

**Priority: MEDIUM — a live rules leak in books 1–6 today; it makes one-time treasure farmable.**

The corpus's standard once-only-reward idiom puts a redirect at the head of a `boxes=` section and
the reward below it, both as siblings:

```xml
<section name="16" boxes="1">
  <p><if ticks="1">If there is a tick in the box, <goto section="251"/> immediately.</if>
     If not, <tick/> and read on.</p>
  …
  <p>You may choose up to three of the following treasures: <items group="1.16" limit="3"/></p>
  …eight <weapon>/<armour>/<tool>/<item> awards…
</section>
```

The box exists precisely to make the haul one-time, and the printed redirect is the book's way of
saying "leave now". But the port renders the **whole** section: nothing ties the body to the
`<if ticks="0">` branch, so on a revisit the redirect goes live *and the reward does too*.

Confirmed against a real `GameState`. **book1/16** (the sea dragon's hoard): a first visit ticks the
box and takes three treasures; entering again with the box ticked renders the live `<goto 251>`
redirect **and all eight Take buttons live again**. The simpler single-award form of the same shape
behaves the same way: a first visit ticks the box and takes the award, and a revisit re-offers a
live Take that really banks a **second** copy (measured: 1 → 2). Neither is caught by task 27's
`addTick` cap, which only stops the tick *count* from running past `boxes=`; the body was never in
scope for that fix.

book1/16 has carried this since book 1. It is **not** the same thing as an untaken `<if>` branch
rendering greyed-but-visible (deliberate, so the reader keeps the context): here the *taken* branch
says leave, and the section keeps handing out rewards anyway.

Two shapes of fix, and the choice is a design decision rather than an obvious repair:

1. **Source-side** — move each such body inside the `<if ticks="0">` branch. Faithful and needs no
   engine change, but it restructures the paragraph layout of every affected section across the
   whole corpus, and would have to be told apart from the sections where reading on after the
   redirect is genuinely intended.
2. **Engine-side** — treat a `<goto>` inside a *matched* `<if ticks=>` at the head of a section as a
   redirect that holds the rest of the section's effects and awards, the way task 69's fight gate
   holds a post-fight effect. Cheaper and uniform, but it needs a rule for which redirects count, so
   an optional "you may return to X" link is not mistaken for a mandatory one.

Worth settling as part of the same pass: whether `<items group … limit="N">`'s limit persists across
visits or is re-armed per visit. book1/16's first visit correctly stopped at three of eight; what a
*second* visit's allowance should be follows directly from whichever fix above is chosen.

Found during conversion work on an unpublished book, whose sections inherit this idiom rather than
introducing it.

## 215. A self-closing effect tag renders no words, so published sentences print with a hole

**Priority: LOW — cosmetic, but it silently deletes printed words from books 1, 2, 3 and 6 today.**

`renderPassive`'s plain-effect path (`web/js/render-rewards.js`) builds a `span.fx`, fills it with
the node's own children, and then drops it when it is empty:

```js
if (!span.textContent.trim() && isBareBoxTick(node)) span.textContent = 'tick the box';
if (span.textContent.trim()) container.appendChild(span);
```

A **bare section-box `<tick/>`** gets synthesised filler (task 70). Nothing else does. So a
self-closing effect tag written *inline in a printed sentence* — where the sentence's own words are
the thing the tag names — renders **nothing at all**, and the sentence loses those words.

Measured against a real `GameState`: **8 of the 10** inline self-closing title tags in the corpus
print no text.

| section | printed line | renders as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| book1/61 | `Write <gain title="Unspeakable Cultist"/> in the Titles and Honours box` | "Write  in the Titles and Honours box" |
| book1/255 | `awards you the title <gain title="Protector of Sokara"/>.` | "awards you the title ." |
| book1/256 | `He rewards you with the title <gain title="King's Champion"/>.` | "with the title ." |
| book2/405 | `<gain title="Chosen One of Nagil"/>.` | the sentence is only the tag |
| book3/393 | `<gain title="Saviour of Vervayens Isle"/> on your Adventure Sheet.` | " on your Adventure Sheet." |
| book6/12 | `<gain title="Junior Court Rank"/>,` | "," |
| book6/324 | `Lose the title <lose title="Junior Court Rank"/>` | "Lose the title" |
| book6/479 | `<gain title="Enlightened One"/>.` | the sentence is only the tag |

The **rules half is unaffected** — §1.255 really grants the title and §6.324 really removes it; only
the words are lost, which is why it has never shown up as a rules failure. The same rule bites
`<gain shards="500"/>` (confirmed: "He pays you <gain shards='500'/> for it." renders "He pays you
for it." while the 500 Shards are credited).
The **wrapping** form the corpus uses elsewhere is unaffected — book4/228's
`note the title <gain title="Arena Champion">Arena Champion</gain>` prints correctly, as do
book4/444, book4/568, book5/662, book6/339 and book6/384.

Two shapes of fix:

1. **Source-side** — rewrite the ~10 inline tags into the wrapping form the same books already use
   elsewhere. Smallest blast radius and no engine change, but it edits published book text (adding
   back only the words the tag swallowed, so the tag-stripped prose is restored, not altered).
2. **Engine-side** — extend the `isBareBoxTick` synthesis so an empty `span.fx` falls back to a
   label derived from the effect (`rewardLabel` already builds "500 Shards" and a title name for
   choose-one buttons). Uniform, but it invents wording where the author wrote a name, and it must
   not start printing labels for the many *deliberately* wordless tags — the mechanic-only
   `<lose title=…/>` nodes sitting alone inside `<if>`/`<outcome>` wrappers in book1/187,
   book2/18, book2/293, book2/442, book5/148, book5/376, book6/114, book6/118 and book6/589, which
   correctly render nothing today.

Distinguishing those two populations is the actual work: an inline tag has sibling text in its
parent, a mechanic-only one does not. Regression coverage belongs in `suite-render`.

Found during conversion work on an unpublished book, which uses the wrapping form throughout for
exactly this reason. book1/255 has carried the defect since book 1.

## Review log

*Running audit log of the backlog — each pass re-verifies the open items against
the current code and records what was filed, split, or re-confirmed. Task
numbers refer to the contents checklist at the top of the file.*

Reviewed 2026-07-29 (twelfth full pass, after tasks 180–208): started clean at
`9a511ac`. Re-read the completion commits and their regression coverage across imported
state/visit restoration, rule planners, combat/economy, renderer and Story lifecycle,
accessibility, persistence, service-worker ownership, build/CI and workflow documentation.
Rechecked the post-review `Published=` refactor separately because it changed the release
boundary without a task number. No completed rule task needs reopening, and task 207 remains
correctly withdrawn.

Filed **209** (MEDIUM): `Published=` drives only part of a release. The service-worker data /
map inventory and final corpus scan still hard-code six books, the build leaves withdrawn
book outputs behind, and invalid/missing registry entries are skipped or duplicated rather
than rejected. A future book can consequently work online while failing fresh offline play
and escaping the every-section scan. Filed **210** (LOW): task 192's global mobile-drawer
class survives `releaseGameScreen()`, so a modal/recovery transition out of an open Sheet can
make the next game start open with its story and header inert. Both are now closed, so **every
filed task through 210 is complete and the backlog is empty**.

Organization verdict is unchanged: keep the dependency-free ES modules and existing
rule/view boundary. Task 209 belongs at the build/release manifest boundary and task 210 in
the existing app drawer teardown; neither warrants a framework, folder move or broad
refactor. PowerShell 7 build: **4,407 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections generated, **no
generated-file drift**. Validator fixture self-test: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=23 fail=0`**.
DOM-free Node import suite: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=35 fail=0`**.
Fresh-profile Chrome aggregate: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=2100 fail=0`**, title `TESTS_OK`,
including every currently scanned section of all six published books. The connected
interactive browser was unavailable, so this pass does not claim an additional manual visual
inspection; the repository's real-Chrome headless suite completed normally.

Withdrew 2026-07-27: **207**, filed hours earlier while working task 204. It claimed that a
statement above its own `<while>` pass's roll wrongly reads the previous pass's value. Writing
the fixture settled it the other way: a section executes SEQUENTIALLY in JaFL, so in iteration 2
a line above the roll really does run before it and really does see iteration 1's value. The
"fix" (a position-blind pass seed) would defer such a read forever, since its own roll can never
re-assert in time — the attempt either used the stale value anyway or never applied the effect.
The fixture stayed as `task204b` in `suite-inventory`, pinning the sequential reads, and
`viewPendingVars` now documents why the per-pass set is position-sensitive on purpose. Nothing in
the corpus is written this way either, so no behaviour changed. With that, **every filed task
through 206 is complete and the backlog is empty**.

Reviewed 2026-07-26 (eleventh full pass, after tasks 175–179): started clean at
`d8e8c59`. Re-read the rule/state/economy modules, every renderer and app lifecycle,
service worker/build/CI paths, focused suites and workflow docs; compared live rule seams
against the XML/reference implementation; and checked source/generated parity, all explicit
bundled-book targets and every live tag/condition family. Filed **180–184** (HIGH):
untrusted fight memos reach `innerHTML`; task 175 leaves ordinary/derived/loop/navigation
consumers of a provisional reroll live; dice callbacks survive Save & quit; disease immunity
does not block affliction admission; and named cleanup removes only one stacked cumulative
curse.

Filed **185–197** (MEDIUM): wildcard affliction penalties, explicit equipment selection,
descriptor-correct market sales, hidden rest, failed-new-game recovery, cache namespace
ownership, narrow header and mobile-Sheet behavior, speech callback generations, transition
focus, the DOM-free import boundary, canonical app stamping and CI source/generated
verification. Filed **198–202** (LOW): deletion failure ordering, stronger source validation,
accurate suite-fatal documentation, creation-draft survival across SW activation, and the
remaining bounded accessibility semantics. The optional full-art basename collision was
reviewed but not filed: all three shipped illustrations are unique and broader art import is
not current scope.

Organization verdict remains the same: no framework, dependency, folder move or wholesale
module split is warranted. The fixes have existing owners; task 181 belongs in the DOM-free
planner/visit boundary, 180 at import rehydration plus safe DOM construction, 182 in Story
lifecycle, and the accessibility items are small app/view contracts. PowerShell 7 build:
**4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections generated, with source/data parity intact. The
build exposed task 196 by changing only the generated stamp/cache identity on unchanged
tracked content. Fresh-profile aggregate smoke: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1692 fail=0`**,
including every section of all six books. The review changed only this backlog.

Reviewed 2026-07-22 (tenth full pass, after tasks 173–174): started clean at
`2245eae`. Reviewed every first-party runtime/rule/view/persistence module, the web shell
and service worker, build scripts, focused suites, XML integration and generated/reference
boundaries. Rechecked the architecture/import graph and sampled the corpus at each suspected
rule seam. Filed **175** (HIGH): blessing rerolls occur after branch effects have committed;
§6.49 removes the offered blessing before its button can work, while damage/permanent losses
and random rewards can survive a replacement result. Filed **176–177** (MEDIUM): unavailable
book input rejects outside the demo/import/load recovery UI; and the shared/custom modal
paths still lack complete keyboard isolation/focus restoration. Filed **178–179** (LOW): the
direct flee-choice path missed task 169's durable retry option, and lazy service-worker cache
writes are not held by the fetch event lifetime.

Organization verdict remains unchanged: these are bounded lifecycle and accessibility
contracts, not evidence for a framework, directory move or broad module split. Task 175's
pending-result rule belongs in a DOM-free planner/visit record with the view limited to its
controls; 176 belongs at the app/data validation boundary; 178 should reuse the existing
navigation policy; and 179 is a local service-worker promise fix. PowerShell 7 build:
**4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections generated, **no generated-file drift**.
Fresh-profile aggregate smoke: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1619 fail=0`**, including every
section of all six books. The review itself changed no production/generated files.

Reviewed 2026-07-22 (ninth full pass): started clean at `68f7b8f` after tasks
168–172. Re-read the five implementations and their regressions line-by-line,
re-traced every navigation consequence/transaction/save/resume boundary, then
rechecked the unchanged engine/state/combat/market ownership, renderer split,
production/test imports, source/generated boundary, build/SW inputs and docs.
Filed **173** (MEDIUM): task 169 persists the durable consequence after a failed
target but leaves its retry in `Story._pendingRetry`; the v1 visit serializer,
sanitizer and resume path all omit it, so a reload at the recovery screen keeps
the spent item/wound/outcome and permanently loses the destination. Existing
tests prove only the same in-memory Story instance.

Duplication verdict remains **bounded**. A fresh normalized eight-line scan now
finds one production clone: the local click/append/return tail shared by the
equipment and profession pickers in `render-rewards.js`; extracting that tail
would obscure two short, policy-specific controls, so it stays. The only
actionable copy is the identical controllable navigation Promise repeated three
times inside `suite-actions.js`; filed as test-only LOW task **174**. Tasks
170–172 otherwise removed the display/combat/roll copies without creating a
generic framework, and their rules remain explicit.

Organization verdict: the flat dependency-free ES-module structure is still the
right shape. The production import graph has no direct cycle; rules modules do
not construct UI DOM; `render.js` remains a lifecycle/walk facade while the five
focused view modules own their named controls; and the large `engine.js` and
`state.js` are well-sectioned single owners rather than candidates for a
line-count split. Every shipped module is documented and precached. No folder
move, framework, build layer or broad refactor is recommended. PowerShell 7
build: **4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections generated, **no generated-file
drift**. Fresh-profile aggregate smoke: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1605 fail=0`**,
including every section of all six books.

Reviewed 2026-07-21 (eighth full pass, including duplication audit): started
clean at `eac1790` after tasks 166–167 and the initial filing of 168. Re-read
both implementations line-by-line, traced every `Story.navigate` caller and
save/commit/status boundary, checked all story/sheet/menu interactions that stay
live during an async move, and re-audited engine/state/combat/market, renderer
ownership, production/test imports, content/source-generated boundaries,
build/SW inputs and documentation. Task **168** is confirmed but upgraded LOW →
MEDIUM and materially rescoped: `_txnSuppress` is global while unrelated story,
sheet and explicit Save & quit controls remain active, so the risk includes
successful moves, ignored secondary detours and false-success explicit saves —
not only a dropped sheet mutation on a rejected fetch. Filed **169** (MEDIUM):
task 167 transacts prices but consequence-first resurrection/item/flee/combat
paths have no rollback-or-retry contract; a cross-book resurrection proves a
live target can fail after the deal is already consumed.

Duplication verdict: there is **bounded duplication, not repository-wide
copy-paste sprawl**. A normalized exact-window scan found no eight-line clones
across the seven focused test suites and only four production windows at that
size. The actionable copies are filed as LOW maintenance tasks **170–172**:
canonicalise the duplicated `titleCase`/`escapeHtml` and three item-bonus label
implementations (170); extract small shared controls from the parallel
single/group combat views, whose drift already caused tasks 83/87/91/162/166
(171); and share roll widget/gate/memo primitives while keeping the four roll
algorithms explicit (172). `commitTxn()`'s exact copy of `commitVisit()` is
folded into 168 because that transaction must change anyway. Deliberately left
alone: the purpose-specific `previewProse`/`renderStatic` tree walkers, the
forced-buy/transfer gate collectors and small market/reward button tails — their
similarity is local, their policies differ, and another abstraction would cost
more clarity than it saves. Test fixture rebuilding is intentional suite
isolation; generated JSON and ignored `*temp.xml`/`*old.xml` source files are not
production-code duplication.

Organization verdict: the flat dependency-free ES-module structure remains the
right shape. Rules still live in DOM-free engine/state/planner modules, view
files remain responsibility-based, the production import graph has no direct
cycle, and `engine.js`/`state.js` are large but cohesive. No directory move,
framework, build layer or broad file split is recommended; the targeted tasks
above are enough. PowerShell 7 build: **4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections
generated, **no generated-file drift**. Fresh-profile aggregate smoke:
**`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1526 fail=0`**, including every section of all six books.

Reviewed 2026-07-21 (seventh full pass): started clean at `793ab8e` after tasks
161–165. Re-traced the cumulative transition/combat persistence changes,
renderer lifecycle, state/save API and live navigation call sites; rechecked the
production/test import graph, rules/view boundary, module ownership, source vs
generated files, build/SW inputs, documentation and the new Markdown rule-doc
copies; and scanned the corpus for concrete triggers before filing tasks
**166–167**. Task 166 (HIGH) is a direct regression in task 7's safety contract:
the new explicit visit saves bypass `changed()`'s listeners, so final quota
failures are silent, recovery is not observed, and ctx-only progress does not
advance the save-card timestamp. Task 167 (MEDIUM) is the remaining pre-arrival
atomicity gap: paid cross-book choices persist the deduction before the target
fetch is accepted or the spent source frame is durable, and rejected promises
also strand the navigation guard. Live paid routes prove this is not synthetic.

Organization verdict: the repository is still arranged the right way. The flat
dependency-free ES-module layout remains appropriate; the task-119 view split is
cohesive, task 163 removed the one direct roll/choice module cycle, task 164's
focused suites no longer boot `app.js`, and rules still live behind DOM-free
engine/state/planner modules. `engine.js` and `state.js` remain large but have
single, well-sectioned ownership, so a directory reshuffle or line-count split
would add indirection rather than clarify responsibilities. The two findings
are persistence protocol defects, not evidence that the file layout needs a
redesign. PowerShell 7 build: **4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections
generated, **no generated-file drift**. Fresh-profile aggregate smoke:
**`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1493 fail=0`**, including every section of all six books.

Reviewed 2026-07-21 (sixth full pass): started clean at `cb082e1` after the
task-115–160 burn-down. This pass reviewed the cumulative persistence and
renderer changes since the fifth audit, traced every visit-transition/combat
save boundary against the provider-written record, checked the production and
test import graphs, re-read the module/build/SW/docs contracts, rebuilt all
bundled data, and ran the aggregate browser suite on a fresh Chrome profile.
Filed tasks **161–165**. The severe finding is the remaining visit-transition
atomicity hole (161, HIGH): `goTo()`/`restoreReturn()`/`undo()` can autosave the
new state position while Story still serializes the old visit, and neither
`begin()` nor `goBack()` guarantees a final correcting save. A no-entry-effect
destination therefore reloads through stale migration; pure `<return>` sections
§4.69/§5.410/§6.448a lose their frame and can fresh-re-enter the source. The
independent combat gap (162, MEDIUM) is the same invariant at an action boundary:
continuing single/group rounds and blessing retries redraw directly without a
post-mutation visit save, so reload can heal the foe or restore a partial round.

Organization verdict: the production layout is still fundamentally sound. The
task-119 split made `render.js` a 1,210-line lifecycle/dispatch facade and left
cohesive view modules; `engine.js` and `state.js` are large but internally
sectioned around one rule engine and one aggregate game model, so splitting them
for line count alone would add indirection without a cleaner ownership boundary.
No directory reshuffle or framework/build layer is warranted. The concrete
post-split debts are bounded: break the direct `render-rolls` ↔ `render-choices`
ES-module cycle and align AGENTS/README plus stale comments/help text (163); prune
the copied whole-harness imports so focused suites stop evaluating unrelated
`app.js` boot code (164); and repeat task 141's archive maintenance now that
115–160 are complete (165). Source/generated ownership, the flat no-dependency
module scheme, core rules/view separation, service-worker required-module list,
content-hash inputs and licence boundary all checked clean. PowerShell 7 build:
**4,377 XML files valid**, 4,369 sections generated, **no generated-file drift**.
Fresh-profile smoke: **`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1462 fail=0`**, including every
section of all six books.

Re-prioritised 2026-07-20 (backlog re-review — no new code audit; the fifth-pass
verdicts stand). The burn-down cleared every HIGH and MEDIUM task, leaving all 17
open items in LOW. Two were under-ranked and are moved LOW → MEDIUM: **134** (a
multi-candidate market sell irreversibly destroys the wrong ship+cargo, or the
named weapon over a generic one — the same irreversible-loss severity that moved
118 to HIGH; its dependency, the 117/118 shared loss matcher, is now done) and
**137** (a save persisted without its `fl_meta` entry silently overwrites a whole
adventurer — a high-consequence save-integrity loss, unblocked now that 116 has
rewritten the persistence schema). 134 leads the MEDIUM block, then 137. The
remaining LOW bucket — never impact-ranked before (it carried filing order) — is
reordered: zero-risk signal protection first (**142** CI verdict grep, **143**
post-report silent-pass, **144** no-op rebuild cache-bust — the logic that moved
140/141 up), then the real-but-rare player-facing bugs (**149**, **148**, **138**),
a11y + info UX (**153**, **139**), the divergence/robustness/polish grab-bags
(**135**, **136**, **151**, **152**), and the three latent, no-corpus-trigger
items last (**145**, **150**, **160**). Everything else was re-confirmed LOW.
Work order is now 134 → 137 → 142 → 143 → 144 → 149 → 148 → 138 → 153 → 139 →
135 → 136 → 151 → 152 → 145 → 150 → 160.

Reviewed 2026-07-19 (fifth full pass): started clean at `383aede` (task 119
phases 1+2 freshly landed), suite green on a fresh profile at the reviewed
tree (`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1288 fail=0`). Method: two deep subsystem sweeps
(engine/state core; renderer/view), each finding verified against the code,
the live XML and the JaFL reference, with the highest-severity premises
re-verified line-by-line by a second reader; combat/market, build/CI/SW/docs
and the test harness were reviewed inline (three further parallel sweeps were
started and deliberately stopped; their scopes were re-covered inline). Filed
tasks **142–160**. The headline is a save/load atomicity family that is the
systemic successor to task 116 — the persisted visit record is not atomic with
the live visit: `begin()` autosaves the new section against the OLD ctx on
almost every navigation (154, HIGH — work this first); one-shot rest/buy/roll
memos are written after the saving mutation, so a reload repeats them,
re-opening 129/130 via save-scumming (155); and a mid-visit reload drops armed
`<tick special=>` fight bonuses/penalties (156) — one deferred-save fix likely
closes all three. Independent rules divergences: item-name globs never match —
§4.482/§6.201 unreachable, §6.144's trophy head never taken (157); two
written-max Stamina clamps still strip aura headroom, 124's siblings (158);
resurrection revives at half Stamina where the book and JaFL say full, a rule
that predates task 34 and was never reference-checked (159). View-layer races:
the dice-animation window lands pending rolls on the wrong visit (146) and
navigation has no in-flight guard — double-clicks double-run leave hooks and
entry effects (147); plus undo's stale return frame (148), pay-before-chooser
leaks (149), the latent renderIfChain else/elseif divergence (150), the
dead-end fallback counting disabled controls (151), a view polish grab-bag
(152) and a11y quick wins (153). Infra/tests: CI's verdict grep matches the
whole DOM dump — failing runs are misdiagnosed as bootstrap FATALs today, and
a source literal could false-pass tomorrow (142, proven against a real and a
hand-flipped dump); a failing `ok()` after report() is the harness's one
remaining silent-pass vector (143); meta.json's embedded build date busts
every installed player's cache on a no-op rebuild (144); payChoiceCost
validates a tag/wildcard payment it can never consume, latent (145); and the
task-117 loss matcher's two latent gaps (160). Task 119 gained a phase-3
guidance note: extract the remaining rule pockets (renderPassive's cascade,
grantChoosableReward, renderChoice's gates, branch resolution, the group
planner) as tested DOM-free planners BEFORE moving view files, and plan a
fourth rolls+branches view module. Checked clean this pass: task-115 detours
(every navigation routes through `Story.navigate`), 116's ctx serialization
round-trip, the memo-path tripwire, listener/XSS hygiene, a 4,437-section
corpus scan for the mixed flag-reward double-grant seam (zero fall-throughs),
`sanitizeData` field coverage, `canonCargo` folding, the task-128 equipment
fold (the real hyperium wand matches), combat.js blessing/reroll/group-fight
semantics, market transactions (the sole `currency=` market, book2/495, holds
no inline buys), the build scripts (validation-first, deterministic, the stamp
covers everything the SW precaches), the README module table, regression
coverage for all sixteen recent fixes, the every-section corpus suite, and
the NOTICE/licence split. Open items 134–139 were deliberately not re-verified
this pass (the fourth-pass verdicts stand); 119's progress claim was assessed
(~80% true) and extended rather than re-litigated.

Reviewed 2026-07-16 (fourth full pass): started clean at `b012eff` (no code
changes since the third pass — this pass was an independent re-audit with fresh
eyes: six parallel subsystem sweeps over engine/render/state/app/combat/market/
corpus/build, each finding verified against code, live XML, the JaFL reference
and TASKS.md before filing; the sweep was interrupted mid-run by an org spend
limit and resumed, so its coverage is recorded per area below). All seven open
premises re-verified: **115** confirmed but corrected (the live failure mode is
a *stale* return frame, not the fresh-visit fallback; the death→resurrection
path at app.js:649 added to the sweep), **116/117/118/119/120** confirmed as
filed (scope notes added: 117 gains the forced-payment seam, 119 the
non-recursive stamp collector trap, 120 two async-error harness gaps), and
**121** confirmed by live repro but rescoped — stamp-version.ps1 already runs
under 5.1, and the real blocker is engine-dependent output (culture-aware
`Sort-Object` changed the stamp hash; `ConvertTo-Json` escaping reformats the
book JSONs), so 5.1 parity is more than the punctuation fix. Filed tasks
**122–141**: roll-less `<outcome codeword=>` tables dead-end eight sections —
confirmed live at `?demo=4.2`, which renders the accept-your-fate button (122);
the disease/poison blessing's two un-aliased names (123); load/import stripping
aura Stamina (124); ungated flag-linked item rewards — §3.346's repeatable free
200 Shards (125); collapsed groups dropping `<buy>` — §5.192's Wrath of God
unobtainable (126); un-canonicalised abbreviated cargo names breaking the
shipping economy (127); §5.680's always-true bare-ability disjunct handing out
the ring of ultimate power (128); repeatable free fixed rests (129); inline-buy
quantity default (130); cache `max=` semantics incl. §4.263's money-doubling
(131); `<if blessing="?">` (132); stale story pane after sheet mutations (133);
market-sell first-match (134); renounce keeping god-tied resurrections (135); an
engine grab-bag — `tenth`, cargo-loss quantity, `description=`, `<set>`
identifier edges, `<buy force>` (136); save/meta orphan slots (137); offline
query-string navigations (138); foreign currencies missing from the sheet (139);
AGENTS.md's 404 test URL + CI's unrecognised `RESULT FATAL` (140); and archiving
done details out of this file (141). A fresh strict corpus pass re-confirmed
**4,369 sections, 0 parse errors, 0 name mismatches, 0 dangling Book 1–6
targets** (11 sections with no inbound markup link are inherited data quirks,
e.g. book4/69's own text says so). Checked and deliberately **not** filed:
market-level `buy=/sell="f"` column flags are ignored but harmless (no
opposite-side prices exist in any of the 9 affected markets); `inferDice`'s
1-die inference is correct for the corpus's only all-≤6 table (book3/411); the
six non-storm `<reroll>`s carry no effect children; `<outcomes var="z">`
(book6/731) works because every child repeats the `var=`; `<goto visit="t">`
(§4.231) is a spec'd no-op; `<trade name=>` ship rows and `header type="ships"`
are handled/display-only; task 30's documented repeat-outcome limitation was
re-examined (§5.674's pay-per-attempt cure is its worst live case) and left as
documented. Suite green at the reviewed tree, fresh profile:
`RESULT ALL PASS pass=1076 fail=0`.

Re-prioritised 2026-07-16 (same day, follow-up): tasks **141** and **120** moved
LOW → HIGH. 141 (archive done details) goes **first** — zero-risk, no
dependencies, and every subsequent task pays the cost of reading this file. 120
(test split + async-gap hardening) slots after the quick severe fixes 122–124
and **before** the test-heavy 115–117 chain, so the ~20 open tasks write their
tests into focused suites rather than deepening the single-scope monolith, and
the silent-pass vectors are closed before the big fixes' green runs are trusted.
A second ordering pass the same day moved **140** LOW → HIGH second position
(same logic as 141: zero-risk, and it corrects the test instructions every task
follows) and **118** MEDIUM → HIGH immediately after 117 (hard dependency on
117's shared loss matcher — back-to-back keeps the design context warm; the
irreversible plot-item loss also supports HIGH). Checked and deliberately left:
119 stays after the bug burn-down (the fixes build its planners and their tests
de-risk the refactor); 121 stays MEDIUM (dev-only, and its rescope made it a
decision + larger job, not a quick win); 132 stays MEDIUM despite sharing 123's
blessing seam (that seam is trivial to re-enter, unlike 117's matcher); 137
stays after 116 (116 rewrites the persistence schema 137 would touch); 134/136
stay after the matcher and buy-transaction work they reuse. Work order is now
141 → 140 → 122 → 123 → 124 → 120 → 115 → 116 → 117 → 118 → 125–128.

> Older audit passes (the 2026-07-15 third full pass and everything before it) are archived in [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md), alongside the 2026-07-09 external repository review. The most recent pass stays above.
